## Description
Desktop Battle is a 2D shooter featuring a picture of myself, my desk space, a couple crudely-drawn guns, and lots of Clippy. You progress through 3 areas.

I developed the game during a 10-week period in Game Software Development 2 at Rochester Institute of Technology. It was the first time I used C#, and I was offered bonus points for using [XNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) instead of making a console window-based game.

## Features
* Clippy
* A pistol and M16 to shoot Clippy
* 3 stages with waves of Clippy


## How to Play
* WASD or Arrow Keys to move
* Move mouse and click to shoot
* Escape to pause
* Q to switch weapons
